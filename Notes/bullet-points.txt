1. Node.js shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over web sockets.

2. Main purposes are:
    - Web applications(real-time web apps)
    - Network applications
    - Distributed systems
    - General purpose applications

3. Advantage of using node :
    - Build scalable network programs.
    - Fast
    - Concurrency
    - Asynchronous
    - Non-blocking

4. REPL - read, eval, print, loop
        read - user input
        eval - evaluates the user input
        print - prints the result
        loop - loop until the user presses ctrl+c

5. NPM - node package manager
    install 3rd party libraries
    syntax - npm install <library name>

6. Callback functions - is used to deal with multiple requests made to the server.
                        The callback function allows the server to deal with the pending requests first & then call a function when its is completed.

7. Modules - separate js files which can be reused throughout a nodejs application.
            ex - core module(http, etc)

8. Event - Ex - bell rang/ringing(event), stopping the bell(from ringing) is event handler

9. Streams - handling stream of data
            2 types - readable, writeable + duplex(for both r/w operation),transform(output computed based on input)
       *Piping - a mechanism to connect an output of one stream of data to another stream of data.
       *Chaining - is a mechanism to connect output of one stream to another & create a chain of multiple stream operations.
